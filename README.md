## About

This project involved connecting to the NASA API to retrieve information and images/videos. I took this opportunity to learn the commonly used (BLOC architecture)[https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc] since is a well used package in the industry. This package differs from the one I usually work with (flutter_clean_architecture)[https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_clean_architecture], while my current work package serves as a data flow framework, it struggles with state management and required the use of provider/getIt or something like that. For an unrelated example demonstrating this architecture (without documentation, tests or even being good), please see this (link)[https://github.com/guerezi/skywatch]

Despite the challenges faced during development due to learning BLOC on the go, the experience was valuable in enhancing my knowledge and introducing me to a new architecture
